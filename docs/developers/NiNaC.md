# NiNaC

NiNaC is a collection of hacks to extend the abilities to harvest, store, and mine data.

NiNaC is  opt-in capturing of debugging and developmental performance work. Currently the hooks are meant to be completely benign unless a user/developer explicitly loads a separate module, so as not to jeopardize the standard FRE work flow, while still allowing for continuous development of data capturing and warehousing for interested parties.

## Getting Started

Instructions for installation and use are maintained in the NiNaC repository.
