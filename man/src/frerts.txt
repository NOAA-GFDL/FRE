=============

NAME
----
frerts.csh - Creates and runs frerts scripts.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
frerts.csh [OPTIONS] exp [exp ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*frerts.csh* will create and run frerts scripts for a given FRE XML,
with a given platform, target, and list of experiments.

To run a suite of XMLs, platforms, targes, and experiments see *frerts_batch.csh*(1).

OPTIONS
-------

*-x* _<xmlFile>_::
Use the XML file defined by <xmlFile>.

*-p* _<PLATFORM>_::
Use this platform from the XML to setup the specific hardware and
software the experiment will be built and run on.  _<PLATFORM>_ is
of the form <site>.<software>.  <site> must be one of the following
(ncrc1, ncrc2, gfdl, ...), and <software> can be any descriptive
string (no spaces), or "default".  <site> is dependent on where
B<fremake> is executed.  Default: <site>.default.

*-t* _<TARGET>_::
The compilation target.  Predefined targets strings are _repro_,
_prod_, _debug_, _hdf5_ and _openmp_.  The targets can be combined
using a comma separated list (e.g. prod,openmp).  Default: _prod_.

The targets _prod_, _repro_ and _debug_ are mutually exclusive.
Not more than one of these is allowed in the target list.

User defined targets should refer to a <compile> node with the
corresponding value of its target attribute.

*--compile*::
Optionally compile if passed.

*-l* _<LIB_EXPERIMENT_NAME>_::
The experiment that contains required libraries.

*--build_only*::
Optionally do only the compilation and exit.

*--all*::
Optionally run all the experiments in the xml that do not contain
"noRTS" in their name.

*--no_rts*::
Optionally run only the "basic" regression and do not run the "rts"
regression.

*--no_stage*::
Optionally do not stage the data and use "frerun -s" (assumes the data
is pre-staged to ptmp)

*--fre_version* _<FRE_VERSION>::
Specify the FRE version.

*--fre_ops* _<FRERUN_OPTS>_::
Optionally passes a list of options to *frerun*.  The _<FRERUN_OPTS>_
is a semicolon separated list of *frerun* options (see *frerun*(1) for
available options).

*--dry_run*::
Do not submit any jobs, just print the *frerun* commands *frerts.csh* will execute.

_exp_::
Experiment from the _<xmlFile>_.  Run *frelist* to get a list of
available experiments.
