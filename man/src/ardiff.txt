NAME
----
ardiff - utility for diffing cpio or tar archives containing netcdf files and text files

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ls -1 <ARCHIVE_FILES> | ardiff [OPTIONS] 
ardiff < <ARCHIVE_FILE_LIST>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*ardiff* takes a list of *.cpio or *.tar files as input.  It extracts
the archive into a temporary folder and compares the files in the first
archive to the corresponding files in the second archive.  It then
compares the first archive to the third, etc.

*ardiff* compares first with *cmp*.  If that fails it uses the
*nccmp* utility written by Remik Ziemlinski.

By default, *ardiff* calls *nccmp* with the options _-mdq_ (compare
metadata, data, and quiet).
